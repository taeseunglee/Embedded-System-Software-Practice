## Description
This repository for the Emebedded System Software Course(CSE4116) in Sogang Univ.

## Environment
Cross-Platfrom Development  
Host PC: Linux, Ubuntu 14.04 on x64 architecture  
Target Board: Embedded Linux System on ARM architecture  


## Project1
### Description
Implement Clock, Counter, Text Editor, and Draw Board Mode 
using device control and IPC.

## Project2
### Description
Implement programs using system call programming, module programming and device
driver implementation.
1. Implement a module(module/kernel_timer.c) including a device driver(fpga_fnd, fpga_led,
   fpga_dot, fpga_text_lcd) and timer module.
2. Implement a system call(syscall/pack_timer.c) that takes parameters and returns them as a single
